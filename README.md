# Smart_Crack_Detection
This project presents a Smart Crack Detection System for railway tracks, utilizing Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV) techniques. The primary goal of this system is to detect structural cracks in railway tracks automatically, which is crucial for predictive maintenance and accident prevention. By detecting potential issues early, this system aims to enhance the safety and reliability of rail transportation infrastructure. This consists of a rover with sensors to detect obstacles and cracks , and when detected haults the rover and send the location as an alert to the user using gps and gsm modules.
